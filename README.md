# Coasts

## Short Discription

Coasts is an application that aims to promote awareness about climate change. More specifically, Coasts is focused on how climate change impacts the sea level. Rather than focus on the world as a whole, we have decided to make use of specific locations around the world to demonstrate the severity of the issue. Each location featured within the app contains a brief summary of the location, as well as some interesting facts, accompanied by charts and graphs to help the user visualize what is happening. 

What sets this application apart from other resources is its use of an AR feature. The goal is to provide a visual aid that will allow the user to see how the water level will chanage at the featured location in the coming years. A small scale model of a notable place at each location is presented to the user along with a slider representing the years from 2020 to 2100. As the user moves the slider, the water level rises and falls according to where the water level is believed to exist at a particular year. It should be noted that the water levels are not accurate with regard to the model. No one knows how climate change will progress in the future, which means we cannot provide a 100% accurate model of how the sea levesl will exist in the coming years. However, in an effort to demonstrate just how bad the situation could be, we have decided to display a model that falls more in line with worst case scenario predictions.

Finally, in addition to highlighting sea level rise at specific locations around the world, we have included a resources section that allows users to get involved. The sections tells users a bit about certain habits that exacerbate climate change, and encourages them to make small changes in their own lives that can have a bit impact.
